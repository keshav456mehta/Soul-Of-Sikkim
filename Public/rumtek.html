    <h1>Rumtek Monastery</h1>

    <p>
      Rumtek Monastery, also known as the <strong>Dharma Chakra Centre</strong>, is one of the largest and most important monasteries in Sikkim. Originally built in the 16th century by the 9th Karmapa, it was reconstructed in the 20th century under the guidance of the 16th Karmapa after he fled Tibet. Today, it serves as the main seat of the <strong>Kagyü sect of Tibetan Buddhism</strong> outside Tibet.
    </p>

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
      The original monastery was built around 1740 but fell into ruins over time. In 1959, following the Chinese invasion of Tibet, the 16th Karmapa Rangjung Rigpe Dorje escaped to Sikkim and chose Rumtek as his new spiritual center. With the support of the Sikkimese royal family and devotees, the monastery was rebuilt to house sacred relics, ancient manuscripts, and priceless artifacts brought from Tibet.
    </p>

    <h2>Architecture & Layout</h2>
    <p>
      Rumtek is a stunning example of traditional Tibetan monastic architecture. The monastery is a <strong>three-storied structure</strong> adorned with vibrant murals, intricate woodwork, and thangka paintings. The golden stupa inside contains relics of the 16th Karmapa. The complex also includes the <em>Golden Stupa Hall</em>, a meditation hall, and residential quarters for monks. The monastery sits on a hilltop and offers panoramic views of Gangtok and the surrounding valleys.
    </p>

    <h2>Spiritual Importance</h2>
    <p>
      Rumtek is considered the most sacred seat of the Kagyü lineage outside Tibet. It is a major center of Buddhist learning, meditation, and practice. Monks here undergo years of spiritual training, including tantric rituals, meditation practices, and Buddhist philosophy.
    </p>

    <h2>Festivals & Rituals</h2>
    <p>
      The monastery comes alive during its annual festivals:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Losar (Tibetan New Year):</strong> Celebrated with prayers, rituals, and cultural performances.</li>
      <li><strong>Kagyed Dance Festival:</strong> Masked dances performed by monks to drive away evil spirits and welcome good fortune.</li>
      <li><strong>Mahakala Dance:</strong> A powerful tantric dance symbolizing the victory of good over evil.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Visitor Information</h2>
    <p>
      Rumtek is located about 23 km from Gangtok and is easily accessible by road. The monastery is open to visitors throughout the year, though the best time to visit is from <strong>March to June</strong> and <strong>September to December</strong>.
